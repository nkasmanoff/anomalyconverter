    "Taking Chris's advice, I need to update this code so that it can handle longer inputs depending on the decimal value. Newton's method fails for some level of this, so either want to switch to bi section method, or just add some dumb and over the top condition that influences how many data points I do for Newton's where it corresponds to the desired e of the orbit times the number of sig figs in the anomaly to be converted.
